Deepening Glade
The forest stretches up into the hills around you. The setting sun filters through, lighting the small grassy glade in which you stand. A very small stream flows from north to south along the eastern edge. In the center of the glade, large and prominent, is a massive and ancient Stone Table.

Winding Path
You find yourself in what looks like the remains of a forest. The trees are all dead, a few of them fallen over. You feel an overwhelming sense of dread emanating from this former forest. You see a stump, with a wax effigy clumsily laid on top of it.
